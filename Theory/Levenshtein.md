## What is the Levenshtein Algorithm?

The Levenshtein Algorithm calculates the **minimum number of single-character edits** needed to transform one string
into another. These edits can be:

- **Insertion**: Add a character
- **Deletion**: Remove a character  
- **Substitution**: Replace a character

## Core Concept: Dynamic Programming

The algorithm uses a 2D table (matrix) where each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum edit distance between the first
`i` characters of string 1 and the first `j` characters of string 2.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

Let's trace through an example: transforming "**cat**" → "**dog**"

### 1. Initialize the DP Table

```

    ""  d  o  g
""   0  1  2  3
c    1  
a    2  
t    3  
```

- **Row 0**: Cost of inserting characters to get from empty string to "d", "do", "dog"
- **Column 0**: Cost of deleting characters to get from "c", "ca", "cat" to empty string

### 2. Fill the Table Using the Recurrence Relation

For each cell `dp[i][j]`, we have two cases:

**Case 1: Characters match** (`s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]`)

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]  // No operation needed
```

**Case 2: Characters don't match**

```
dp[i][j] = 1 + min(
    dp[i-1][j],    // Deletion: remove char from s1
    dp[i][j-1],    // Insertion: add char to s1
    dp[i-1][j-1]   // Substitution: replace char in s1
)
```

### 3. Complete Table for "cat" → "dog"

```
    ""  d  o  g
""   0  1  2  3
c    1  1  2  3
a    2  2  2  3
t    3  3  3  3
```

Let me trace a few key cells:

- `dp[1][1]`: 'c' vs 'd' → don't match → `1 + min(0, 1, 0) = 1`
- `dp[2][2]`: 'a' vs 'o' → don't match → `1 + min(1, 2, 1) = 2`
- `dp[3][3]`: 't' vs 'g' → don't match → `1 + min(2, 3, 2) = 3`

**Final answer**: `dp[3][3] = 3` (substitute c→d, a→o, t→g)

## Visual Example with Operations

Here's what the transformations look like:

```
cat → dat (substitute c with d)
dat → dot (substitute a with o)  
dot → dog (substitute t with g)
```

Total: 3 operations

## Why Dynamic Programming Works

The algorithm works because it follows the **principle of optimality**:

- To find the optimal solution for transforming `s1[0...i]` to `s2[0...j]`
- We only need to consider the optimal solutions for smaller subproblems
- Each cell builds upon previously computed optimal solutions

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m × n) where m and n are string lengths
- **Space Complexity**: O(m × n) for the DP table

## Key Insights

1. **Bottom-up approach**: We solve smaller subproblems first
2. **Optimal substructure**: The optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
3. **Overlapping subproblems**: We reuse previously computed results

## Real-World Applications

- **Spell checkers**: Find closest dictionary words
- **DNA sequence analysis**: Compare genetic sequences
- **Version control**: Calculate file differences
- **Fuzzy string matching**: Search with typos
- **Auto-complete features**: Suggest corrections

The beauty of this algorithm is that it guarantees finding the true minimum number of edits needed, making it incredibly useful for any
application requiring string similarity measurement.
