The two-pointer approach is a popular technique in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) used to solve a variety of
problems involving arrays or linked lists. This approach involves using two pointers to iterate through the
data structure, often in a single pass, to achieve an efficient solution. Below are some key concepts and examples
of the two-pointer technique:

### Key Concepts:

# Initialization:
Two pointers are initialized, typically at different positions in the data structure. Common initializations
include one pointer starting at the beginning and the other at the end.

# Movement:
The pointers are moved towards each other or in a specific direction based on the problem's requirements.
The movement depends on conditions evaluated during iteration.

# Conditions:
Conditions are used to determine when and how the pointers should move. These conditions are crucial for ensuring
the pointers converge or diverge based on the problem.


###Common Use Cases:

# Finding a Pair with a Given Sum:
Given a sorted array, find two numbers that add up to a specific target value.
Approach: Initialize one pointer at the beginning and the other at the end. Move the pointers towards each other
based on the sum of the elements at the pointers.

# Removing Duplicates from a Sorted Array:
Remove duplicates in-place from a sorted array and return the new length.
Approach: Use one pointer to iterate through the array and another to keep track of the position of the unique elements.

# Reversing a String or Array:
Reverse the characters of a string or elements of an array in place.
Approach: Initialize one pointer at the beginning and the other at the end. Swap the elements at the pointers and
move them towards each other until they meet.
