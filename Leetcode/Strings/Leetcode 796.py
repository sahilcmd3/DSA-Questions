# Rotate String

"""Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.
A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.
    For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift."""

        return goal in doubled  # s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab" doubled = "abcdeabcde", and "cdeab" is a substring â†’ returns True.
