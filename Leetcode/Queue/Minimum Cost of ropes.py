# GFG Minimum cost of ropes
"""Great question, Sahil. The line `heapq.heapify(ropes)` transforms the list `ropes` into a **min-heap**, *in place*.

### ðŸ”§ What is a min-heap?
A **min-heap** is a binary heap where the smallest element is always at the frontâ€”i.e., `ropes[0]` will always be the shortest rope.
It allows you to efficiently extract the two smallest ropes for merging.

### ðŸ’¡ Why use `heapify()`?
Without `heapify`, you'd have to search the list every time for the two smallest elementsâ€”costing O(n) per operation. `heapify()` lets us do:
- `heapq.heappop()` â†’ pop the smallest element in O(log n)
- `heapq.heappush()` â†’ insert a new rope in O(log n)

So with `heapq.heapify(ropes)`, you instantly prepare `ropes` for priority queue behavior. The total build time is **O(n)**, and it
unlocks efficient greedy operations.
