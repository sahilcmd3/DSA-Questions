# Reverse Pairs

"""Given an integer array nums, return the number of reverse pairs in the array.

A reverse pair is a pair (i, j) where:
    0 <= i < j < nums.length and

"""Time Complexity Analysis
Merge Sort: Standard merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) for sorting an array of size n.

Counting Reverse Pairs:
    - During the merge step, for each element in the left array, you iterate through the right array until the condition 
    left[i] > 2 * right[j] fails.
    - Because of the two-pointer strategy and the sorted nature of the arrays, this part doesn't result in a nested O(nÂ²) loop.
    - Instead, each pointer (i, j) only moves forward across the entire array, making the reverse pair counting inside each merge step O(n).

Final Complexity: At each recursive level of merge sort, you're doing O(n) work. There are log n levels of recursion, so the total 
time complexity is: O(n log n)"""
