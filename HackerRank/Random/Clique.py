"""# Turán's Theorem - Detailed Explanation

## What is Turán's Theorem?

Turán's theorem is a fundamental result in extremal graph theory that answers the question: **"What is the maximum number of 
edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a given size?"**

## The Problem Statement

Given:
- A graph with `n` vertices
- We want to avoid having a clique of size `r+1` (denoted as K_{r+1})

**Question**: What is the maximum number of edges we can have?

## Turán's Theorem Statement

**Theorem**: The maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph that contains no K_{r+1} is given by the Turán graph T(n,r).

The number of edges in T(n,r) is:
```
t(n,r) = (1 - 1/r) * n²/2
```

More precisely:
```
t(n,r) = ⌊n²/2⌋ - ⌊n²/(2r)⌋
```

## What is a Turán Graph T(n,r)?

A Turán graph T(n,r) is a **complete r-partite graph** where:
- The vertices are divided into `r` groups (parts)
- Every vertex in one part is connected to every vertex in every other part
- No vertices within the same part are connected
- The parts are as equal in size as possible

### Construction of T(n,r):
1. Divide n vertices into r parts
2. If n = qr + s (where q = ⌊n/r⌋ and s = n mod r):
   - s parts have size (q+1)
   - (r-s) parts have size q
3. Connect every pair of vertices that are in different parts

## Why Does This Work?

### Key Insight: No K_{r+1} Exists
- In T(n,r), vertices are divided into r parts
- To form a clique of size r+1, we would need r+1 vertices
- But since there are only r parts, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two vertices must be in the same part
- However, vertices in the same part are not connected!
- Therefore, no K_{r+1} can exist in T(n,r)

### Maximality
Turán proved that T(n,r) has the maximum possible number of edges among all K_{r+1}-free graphs.

## Calculating Edges in T(n,r)

### Method 1: Direct Counting
If we have parts of sizes n₁, n₂, ..., nᵣ, then:
```
Number of edges = Σ(i<j) nᵢ * nⱼ
```

### Method 2: Complement Counting
```
Total edges = (Complete graph edges) - (Edges within parts)
            = C(n,2) - Σᵢ C(nᵢ, 2)
            = n(n-1)/2 - Σᵢ nᵢ(nᵢ-1)/2
```

### Example Calculation
For n=5, r=2 (avoiding K₃):
- Divide 5 vertices into 2 parts: {3, 2}
- Edges within parts: C(3,2) + C(2,2) = 3 + 1 = 4
- Total possible edges: C(5,2) = 10
- Turán edges: 10 - 4 = 6

## Application to the Clique Problem

### The Key Question
Given a graph with n vertices and m edges, what is the minimum size of the largest clique that **must** exist?

### Using Turán's Theorem
1. For each possible clique size k, calculate t(n, k-1)
2. If m > t(n, k-1), then the graph **must** contain a clique of size k
3. Use binary search to find the smallest such k

### Why This Works
- t(n, k-1) is the maximum edges possible without K_k
- If our graph has more than t(n, k-1) edges, it **cannot** avoid having K_k
- Therefore, K_k must exist!

## Examples

### Example 1: n=4, m=5
- t(4,1) = 0 (no edges to avoid K₂)
- t(4,2) = 4 (maximum edges to avoid K₃)
- t(4,3) = 6 (maximum edges to avoid K₄)

Since m=5 > t(4,2)=4, the graph must contain K₃.
Since m=5 < t(4,3)=6, K₄ is not guaranteed.
**Answer**: Minimum clique size is 3.

### Example 2: n=5, m=7
- t(5,1) = 0
- t(5,2) = 6 (divide into {3,2}, edges = 3*2 = 6)
- t(5,3) = 8 (divide into {2,2,1}, edges = 2*2 + 2*1 + 2*1 = 8)

Since m=7 > t(5,2)=6, must contain K₃.
Since m=7 < t(5,3)=8, K₄ is not guaranteed.
**Answer**: Minimum clique size is 3.

## Implementation Insight

The binary search works because:
- If m > t(n, k-1), then clique size ≥ k
- If m ≤ t(n, k-1), then clique size < k (we can construct a graph avoiding K_k)

We search for the smallest k where m > t(n, k-1).

## Historical Context

- **Pál Turán** (1940s): Proved this theorem
- **Motivation**: Extremal graph theory - how large can a graph be under certain restrictions?
- **Applications**: Ramsey theory, combinatorial optimization, coding theory

## Why It's Beautiful

Turán's theorem elegantly connects:
- **Extremal problems** (maximum edges)
- **Structural properties** (clique-free graphs)
- **Constructive solutions** (explicit graph construction)
- **Algorithmic applications** (binary search solutions)

The theorem provides both an upper bound (how many edges are possible) and a construction (the Turán graph achieves this bound), 
making it a complete solution to the extremal problem."""
